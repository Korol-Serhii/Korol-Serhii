### 🚀 About Me

I am a disciplined and goal-oriented **Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in computer science and a unique background in military leadership. My professional philosophy is built on discipline, adaptability, and continuous technological evolution.

My engineering journey began with a deep focus on interface design and client-side logic. I hold a professional diploma in **Software Development**, where I gained expertise in building complex, responsive **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**. Leveraging **JavaScript (ES6+)** and **TypeScript** for type safety and reliability, I engineer scalable solutions within the **React** and **Angular** ecosystems.

However, I do not limit myself to web technologies. My drive to understand low-level system operations led me to expand into system programming. I currently develop high-performance solutions using:

* **C++ & C#:** For memory management, pointer arithmetic, and building robust backend services.
* **SQL & Database Design:** For efficient data modeling and querying.
* **DevOps Practices:** Utilizing **Docker** and **Linux** environments to ensure consistent deployment and system stability.

My 8+ years of military service—ranging from Scout to Squad Leader—have instilled in me a unique set of soft skills critical for engineering: crisis management, effective team communication, and an execution-oriented mindset.

Currently, I am focused on the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Defense Technology**.
