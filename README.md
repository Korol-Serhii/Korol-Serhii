### 🚀 About Me
I am a disciplined and goal-oriented **Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in computer science and a unique background in military leadership.

My professional journey is defined by continuous evolution. I hold a diploma in **Software Development** (specializing in Front-End) and have expanded my stack to include system programming with **C++** and **C#**, as well as database management and DevOps practices. My 8+ years of military service—ranging from Scout to Squad Leader—have instilled in me the ability to solve complex problems under pressure, manage teams effectively, and adapt rapidly to new technologies.

Currently, I am focused on developing robust software solutions and exploring the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Defense Technology**.
