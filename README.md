### 🚀 About Me
I am a **Software Engineer** with a unique background in military leadership and defense technology.

My journey is defined by discipline and continuous evolution. With over **8 years of military service** (from Scout to Squad Leader), I have mastered the art of making critical decisions under pressure and managing teams in high-stakes environments. I have successfully transitioned these skills into software engineering, combining a structured mindset with modern technical capabilities.

Currently, I focus on building robust software solutions and exploring engineering applications for the defense sector (MilTech).
